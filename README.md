# HTML/CSS Practice Repository

This repository is a collection of my practice sections for HTML and CSS. I use it to experiment with different HTML and CSS implementations, and to keep a record of my progress.

Each section is stored in its own directory, and includes all necessary files and assets. Feel free to browse through the sections and see how I've implemented different features and styles.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!
